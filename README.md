# FlnBusRoutesApp
Bus routes in Florian√≥polis, SC, Brazil

Android App created with C# using Xamarin Studio + Visual Studio 2013

The target framework is Android 4.0.3 because then it's possible to reach 92.2% of the android devices, accordingly to https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html

Tested using emulators for Android Jelly Bean and Kitkat - Nexus 5 (Xamarin Android Player)

There are some packages committed - check the packages folder

The Components folder hasn't been commited due to its deep length (Github complains) so I've added the Xamarin Google Maps zip (google_play_services_5089000_r19.zip) under the packages folder. If you have problems when installing it, please unzip this folder under the Components folder.
